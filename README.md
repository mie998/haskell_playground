System requirements 
  Note: On OS X, in the course of running ghcup you will be given a dialog box to install the command line tools. Accept and the requirements will be installed for you. You will then need to run the command again.
On Darwin M1 you might also need a working llvm installed (e.g. via brew) and have the toolchain exposed in PATH.
Press ENTER to proceed or ctrl-c to abort.
Installation may take a while.
